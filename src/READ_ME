Polish Expression Parser
Cole Philips

this program takes in a user-inputted mathematical expression through Polish notation.
The parser works by turning the input into tokens that are used to solve the equation.
the program then returns the answer as a result.

Future updates:
1. handle user error with mis-input
2. more complex equation handling
